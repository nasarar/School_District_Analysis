# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
A school board is requesting to analyze student and school data to recalculate school fundings based on the standardized test scores for Math and Reading subjects. Additionally, the dataset has to be cleaned due to an academic misconduct from Thomas High School's 9th Grade students thus having to disregard that portion of the data. A list of deliverables is highlighted below as per the school board's requirements.
1. Clean up dataset not to include prefix and suffix to student's names

2. Clean up dataset by rendering Thomas High School's 9th Grade students math and reading grades as NaN (Not a Number).

3. Merge both student and school datasets to create a complete student dataframe

4. Create different types of summary based on the following criterias: Total Students, Total Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, % Overall Passing (passes both math and reading).
    - District Summary
    - School Summary
    - School Spending Summary
    - School Size Summary
    - School Type Summary
 
 5. Create a Math and Reading Scores summary based each grade for all schools
 
 6. Create a dataframe of the Top and Bottom 5 performing schools in the district.
